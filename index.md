## About Me 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de) working with
[Dr. Krikamol Muandet](http://group.krikamol.org/) in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. My research focuses on improving the
reliability of machine learning algorithms by integrating principles from economics and statistics. Prior to joining CISPA,
I pursued my DPhil within the [Oxford Computational Statisics and Machine Learning Group](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the
University of Oxford, under the supervision of [Prof. Dino Sejdinovic](https://sejdino.github.io/),
[Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/)
and [Prof. Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/). 
During my DPhil, I have interned at [Amazon Transportation Service group](https://www.amazon.jobs/de/business_categories/transport)
as an Applied Scientist working on coherent forecasting challenges for EU logistics network.
I have also interned at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://ei.is.mpg.de/) where I 
worked on improving econometric models with modern machine learning methods. I previously obtained
a masters and bachelor degree with first class honours in mathematics and statistics at the University of Oxford. During my masters,
I worked with [Prof. Mihaela Van Der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/) on disease trajectory modelling with Bayesian nonparametric models.
