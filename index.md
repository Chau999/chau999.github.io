### Bio üìñ
<p align="justify">
Dr. Siu Lun Chau is an incoming Assistant Professor (commencing May 2025) at the College of <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing">Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore</a>. He will lead the <b>Epistemic Intelligence & Computation (EPIC)</b> Lab, focused on developing intelligent systems that recognise and acknowledge what they don‚Äôt know while effectively communicating what they already know.
</p>

<p align="justify">
From 2023 to 2025, Dr. Chau was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://ri-lab.org/">Rational Intelligence Lab</a> within the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Germany, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.krikamol.org/">Dr. Krikamol Muandet</a>. His research centered on imprecise probabilities, a generalised framework of probability theory, and their application to machine learning challenges, including hypothesis testing and supervised learning under imprecision. Between 2019 and 2023, Dr. Chau pursued his DPhil in Statistics at the <a href="https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, where he worked on the intersection of kernel methods and Gaussian processes with applications to trustworthy machine learning, under the supervision of <a href="https://sejdino.github.io/">Prof. Dino Sejdinovic</a>. During his doctoral studies, he also interned at the <a href="https://ei.is.mpg.de/">Empirical Inference devision of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T√ºbingen</a>, working on enhancing econometric models using modern machine learning techniques. Dr. Chau holds both a Master‚Äôs and a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mathematics and Statistics, graduating with First Class Honours from the University of Oxford, where he received the Departmental Prize for ranking top of his cohort.
</p>


<p align="justify">
In addition to his academic achievements, Dr. Chau enjoys bridging the gap between academia and industry. He interned at <a href="https://relay.amazon.de/?tag=gmar&user=de&ref=gs_c_136100420583xkwd-829792795643_ki">Amazon</a> as an Applied Scientist, addressing coherent forecasting problems for the EU logistics network. He has also provided data science and machine learning consulting services for various startups, including <a href="https://ravio.com/">Ravio</a>, <a href="https://catalystlab.ai/">Catalyst AI</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridgespark.com/">Cambridge Spark</a>, <a href="https://www.potatopro.com/companies/crop4sight">Crop4Sight</a>, and <a href="https://www.verifiedmetrics.com/">gini</a>. Dr. Chau also co-founded OSG Digital, Oxford‚Äôs first student-led data science consultancy group.
