## About Me 
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de) working with
[Dr. Krikamol Muandet](http://group.krikamol.org/) in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. My research focuses on the developing
trustworthy
machine learning algorithms, leveraging insights from economics and statistics. Prior to joining CISPA,
I did my DPhil in the [Oxford Computational Statisics and Machine Learning Group](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the
University of Oxford. I was supervised by [Prof. Dino Sejdinovic](https://sejdino.github.io/),
[Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/)
and [Prof. Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/).
I hold a Masters and Bachelor in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Oxford as well.
I have previously interned at Amazon London and Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
