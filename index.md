## Welcome <i class="em em-wave" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="WAVING HAND SIGN"></i>

<p align="justify">

Hello! My name is Siu Lun Chau (Âë®ÂÖÜÈ∫ü), currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://ri-lab.org/">Rational Intelligence Lab</a> within 
<a href="https://cispa.de">CISPA</a> Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Germany. I work under the guidance of 
<a href="https://www.krikamol.org/">Dr. Krikamol Muandet</a>, focusing on developing machine learning models that acknowledge what they don't know, and effectively communicating what they know. 
To achieve this goal, we need better methods for modelling **uncertainty**, **explanability**, and **preferences**.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Before joining CISPA, I obtanied my DPhil in Statistical Machine Learning from the University of Oxford, where I specialised in kernel methods and Gaussian processes under the supervision of <a href="https://sejdino.github.io/">Prof. Dino Sejdinovic</a>. I also interned at Amazon as an Applied Scientist, where I tackled coherent forecasting problems for the EU logistics network. I also interned at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, where I worked on improving econometric models with modern machine learning approaches.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I hold both a master's and undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Statistics with First Class Honours from the University of Oxford. During my master's, I worked with <a href="https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/">Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar</a> on modelilng diseases trajectories using Bayesian nonparametric methods.
