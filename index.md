<p align="justify" style="color:darkblue;">ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ PhD Opportunities: Interested in bringing in epistemic intelligence to machine learning systems?
I have several openings for PhD students to start in Aug 2026 to be based in Singapore and are looking for candidates with a strong 
mathematical, statistical, or machine learning background. More details can be found <a href="https://chau999.github.

<h2> Welcome </h2>

<p align="justify">

Hi, my name is Siu Lun (Alan) Chau. I am an Assistant Professor in Statistical Machine Learning at the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.

sg/computing">College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore</a>. I lead the 

<a href="https://chau999.github.io/group">Epistemic Intelligence & Computation 

(EPIC) Lab</a>, understanding and addressing epistemic uncertainty in machine learningâ€”how to represent, quantify, propagate, compare, and explain knowledge-level uncertainty in intelligent systems.

<p align="justify">

<b> Background. </b> From 2023 to 2025, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://ri-lab.org/">Rational

Intelligence Lab</a> within CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Germany,

under the supervision of <a href="https://www.krikamol.org/">Dr. Krikamol Muandet</a>. Between 2019 and 2023, I 

pursued my DPhil in Statistics at the <a href="https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a> under the 

supervision of <a href="https://sejdino.github.io/">Prof. Dino Sejdinovic</a>. 

During my doctoral studies, I also interned at the <a href="https://ei.is.mpg.de/">

Empirical Inference department of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen</a> and Amazon UK. 

I hold both a Masterâ€™s and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Statistics, graduating with First Class Honours from the University of Oxford, 
where I received the Departmental Prize for ranking top of the cohort.
