<div style="text-align: justify">
The Epistemic Intelligence & Computation (EPIC) Lab is dedicated to understanding the underlying principles to develop 
uncertainty-aware intelligent systems that can recognise and communicate the limits of their knowledge. Specifically, we ask
<i>how should epistemic uncertainty be mathematically <b>represented, quantified, evaluated, compared, and explained?</b></i> To achieve that, our research
spans a variety of topics between machine learning and statistical methodologies, including:
<ul>
<li>Imprecise Probabilistic Machine Learning</li>
<li>Axiomatic Model Explainability</li>
<li>Probabilistic reasoning with Kernel methods and Gaussian Processes</li>
<li>Decision-making under Epistemic Uncertainty</li>
</ul>

We have openings for PhD students in Aug 2026 to be based in Singapore and are looking for candidates with strong mathematical,
statistical, or machine learning background, please get in touch if you are interested.
