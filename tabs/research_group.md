<h2><center>The Epistemic Intelligence & Computation (EPIC) Lab</center></h2>
<p></p>

<h4><center>🚨We are hiring!🚨</center></h4>
<p align="justify">
Are you passionate about bringing epistemic intelligence to machine learning systems? The <b>EPIC Lab</b> at Nanyang Technological 
University (NTU), Singapore, is recruiting <b>PhD students</b> to start in <b>January 2026</b>!
</p>

<p align="justify">
We are looking for motivated and enthusiastic PhD students to join our research group. If you are curious to dive deeper into the theory 
and practice of uncertainty modelling in machine learning, then we would love to hear from you!
</p>

<h4><center> 🔍 We are looking for students resonating with our interests: </center></h4>
<p align="justify">
Our group explores a wide range of topics under the umbrella of epistemic machine learning, ranging from theory to practice, including 
but not limited to:
</p>
<u>Foundations of:</u>
<ul>
<li>Imprecise probabilistic machine learning: </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Theory of epistemic uncertainty: uncertainty representation, comparisons, quantifications, and evaluations</li>
    <li>Statistical hypothesis testing (two-sample, independence, calibration) under imprecision</li>
    </ul>
<li>Precise probabilistic machine learning:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Statistical inference with kernels (kernel methods, Gaussian processes)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<u>Applications in:</u>
<ul>
<li>Decision-making under uncertainty and imprecision</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Sequential experimental design: Bayesian optimisation, active learning</li>
  <li>Robust prediction under out-of-domain data, strategic manipulation, and conflicting objectives</li>
  <li>Causal inference</li>
  </ul>
<li>Explainability:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Explanations that incorporate predictive uncertainty</li>
        <li>Explanations of uncertainty</li>
    </ul>
<li>Collaborative machine learning</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Human-in-the-loop machine learning</li>
    <li>Rational decision-making under irreducible epistemic uncertainty</li>
    </ul>
</ul>



<h4><center>🈸 So how should you apply? </center></h4>

<p align="justify">
If our mission resonates with you and you’re excited about pursuing research with us, we encourage you to reach out <b>before submitting a 
formal application</b> to NTU. You can reach out to me at <tt>siulun.chau[at]ntu.edu.sg</tt> with the subject title: <tt>New 
application for your group</tt>. You should also read about the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.
sg/education/graduate-programme/ccds-phd-cs-engineering">  application process</a> from NTU first. In your 
email,
we 
would like to see that you have spent a minimum amount of time to find out whether our research aligns well with your interests and have 
a thought whether I might be a good fit as your supervisor. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Note that you are <b>not</b> required to have a clear and thought-out research plan before getting in touch (although it is encouraged). In 
the email, please also attach (if applicable) your
</p>

<ol>
<li>Transcripts</li>
<li>Latest CV</li>
<li>Cover letter</li>
<li>Written work demonstrating your research experience (e.g. a thesis, preprint, published papers)</li>
<li>Contact information of at most two references who are willing to attest your academic aptitude</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">
🚨 <span style="color: #d90010"> Your cover letter should convey your enthusiasm for pursuing a PhD, especially within our group. In your 
personal statement 
(approximately 1–2 pages), please summarise your research background and explain how it connects to the research topics you hope to 
explore. Feel free to mention a research paper from our group that has particularly captured your interest.</span></p>

🚨🚨<span style="color: #c300d9"> I strongly advise applicants to read my <a href="https://chau999.github.
io/assets/research_statement/research_statement.
pdf">research 
statement</a> 
before reaching out. </span>
