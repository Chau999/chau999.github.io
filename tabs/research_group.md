<h1><center>Epistemic Intelligence & Computation (EPIC) Lab</center></h1>
<p></p>

<h4>ðŸš¨We are hiring!ðŸš¨</h4>
<p align="justify">
Are you passionate about bringing epistemic intelligence to machine learning systems? The <b>EPIC Lab</b> at Nanyang Technological 
University (NTU), Singapore, is recruiting <b>PhD students</b> to start in <b>Summer 2025</b>!
</p>
-----
<p></p>

<h4>About Us</h4>
<p align="justify">
The <b>EPIC Lab</b> aims to advance the theory and practice of Epistemic Machine Learning---developing intelligent systems that can 
<span style="color: orangered">recognise the limitation of their knowledge</span>, <span style="color: blue">be able to communicate their 
insights</span>, and 
<span style="color: green">effectively 
collaborate with human 
users</span>.
To 
reach this 
goal,
our research is structured around three major directions,</p>

1. <span style ="color: orangered"><b>Uncertainty-aware Machine Learning</b></span>,
2. <span style ="color: blue"><b>Explainable Machine Learning</b></span>, and
3. <span style="color: green"><b>Preference modelling</b></span>.

<h4> Our Research Interests </h4>
<p align="justify">
Our group explores a wide range of topics under the umbrella of epistemic machine learning, including but not limited to:
</p>
- <b>Imprecise-probabilistic methods:</b> second-order uncertainty, credal sets, imprecise learning
- <b>Precise-probabilistic methods:</b> kernel methods, Gaussian processes, hypothesis testing
- <b>Applications</b>:
    - Human-in-the-loop/Human-AI collaboration
    - Learning from choice and preference feedback
    - Sequential experimental design: active learning and Bayesian optimisation
    - Cooperative game theory
    - Causal inference

<p align="justify">
These areas form the foundation of our work, addressing complex and fundamental challenges in machine learning and AI.

#### How to apply?

<p align="justify">
If our mission resonates with you and youâ€™re excited about pursuing research with us, we encourage you to reach out <b>before submitting a 
formal application</b> to NTU. You can reach out to me at <tt>a.siulun.chau[at]gmail.com</tt> with the subject title: <tt>New 
application for your group</tt>. In your 
email,
we 
would like to see that you have spent a minimum amount of time to find out whether our research aligns well with your interests and have 
a thought whether I might be a good fit as your supervisor. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Note that you are <b>not</b> required to have a clear and thought-out research plan before getting in touch (although it is encouraged). In 
the email, please also attach (if applicable) your
</p>
1. transcripts,
2. latest CV, and
3. some written work demonstrating your research experience (e.g. a thesis, preprint, published papers)

We look forward to receiving your application.
