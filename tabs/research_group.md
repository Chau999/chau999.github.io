# Epistemic Intelligence & Computation (EPIC) Lab

<p align="justify" style="color:red;">ðŸš¨ðŸš¨RECRUITMENT: Interested in developing epistemic intelligence for machine learning systems? Join
us! We have openings for PhD students starting in 2025 summer! You can also read the detailed job description 
<a href="../assets/research_group/recruitment_letter.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">
Our mission is to advance the theory and practice of Epistemic Machine Learning---developing intelligent systems that not only recognise 
the 
limitation of their knowledge, but also be able to communicate their insights and effectively collaborate with human users. To reach this 
goal,
our research is structured around three major directions,</p>

1. **Uncertainty-aware Machine Learning**,
2. **Explainable Machine Learning**, and
3. **Preference modelling**.

<p align="justify">
Under these scopes, our research interests include, but are not limited to, <b>imprecise-probabilistic methods</b> (e.g.,
second-order uncertainty, credal sets, imprecise learning),
<b>precise-probabilistic methods</b>(e.g., kernel methods, Gaussian processes, hypothesis testing), with application areas
include
<b>human-AI collaboration</b>, <b>learning from choice and preference feedback</b>, <b>sequential experimental design</b>(e.g.
active learning and Bayesian optimisation), <b>cooperative game theory</b>, and <b>causal inference</b>. </p>

<p align="justify">
These areas form the foundation of our work, addressing complex and fundamental challenges in machine learning and AI.

#### How to apply?

<p align="justify">
If our group's vision resonates with yours, please get in touch directly before submitting a formal application through the university. 
You can reach out to me at <tt>a.siulun.chau[at]gmail.com</tt> with the subject title: <tt>New application for your group</tt>. In your 
email,
we 
would like to see that you have spent a minimum amount of time to find out whether our research aligns well with your interests and have 
a thought whether I might be a good fit as your supervisor. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Note that you are <b>not</b> required to have a clear and thought-out research plan before getting in touch (although it is encouraged). In 
the email, please also attach (if applicable) your
</p>
1. transcripts,
2. latest CV, and
3. some written work demonstrating your research experience (e.g. a thesis, preprint, published papers)

We look forward to receiving your application.
