  <p align="justify" style="color:red;">ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ PhD Opportunities: Interested in bringing in epistemic intelligence to machine learning systems?
I have several openings for PhD students in 2025 to be based in Singapore and are looking for candidates with a strong statistical, 
mathematical, or machine learning background. More details can be found <a href="https://chau999.github.io/group/">here</a>.</p>

## Welcome
<p align="justify">
Hi, my name is Siu Lun (Alan) Chau. I am an incoming Assistant Professor (commencing May 2025) at the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.
sg/computing">College of Computing 
and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore</a>. I will be leading the <b>Epistemic Intelligence & Computation 
(EPIC)</b> Lab, where our mission is to develop intelligent systems that can recognise the 
limitation of their knowledge (<span style ="color: orangered">uncertainty-awareness</span>), be able to communicate their 
insights (<span style ="color: blue">explainability</span>), and 
effectively 
collaborate with human users (<span style="color: green">preference modelling</span>). You can read more about my research <a

From 2023 to 2025, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://ri-lab.org/">Rational Intelligence Lab</a> within the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Germany, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.krikamol.org/">Dr. Krikamol Muandet</a>. My research centered on imprecise probabilities, a generalised framework of probability theory, and their application to machine learning challenges, including hypothesis testing and supervised learning under imprecision. Between 2019 and 2023, I pursued my DPhil in Statistics at the <a href="https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>,
where I worked on the intersection of kernel methods and Gaussian processes with applications to trustworthy machine learning, under the 
supervision of <a href="https://sejdino.github.io/">Prof. Dino Sejdinovic</a>. 
During my doctoral studies, I also interned at the <a href="https://ei.is.mpg.de/">
Empirical Inference department of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen</a>, working on improving econometric 
models using modern machine learning techniques. I hold both a Masterâ€™s and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Statistics, 
graduating with First Class Honours from the University of Oxford, where I received the Departmental Prize for ranking top of the cohort.

In addition to my research, I also enjoy bridging the gap between academia and industry. I interned at <a href="https://relay.amazon.de/?
tag=gmar&user=de&ref=gs_c_136100420583xkwd-829792795643_ki">Amazon</a> as an Applied Scientist, addressing coherent forecasting problems 
for the EU logistics network. I also provided data science and machine learning consulting services for various startups, including <a 
href="https://ravio.com/">Ravio</a>, <a href="https://catalystlab.ai/">Catalyst AI</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridgespark.
com/">Cambridge Spark</a>, <a href="https://www.potatopro.com/companies/crop4sight">Crop4Sight</a>, and <a href="https://www.
verifiedmetrics.com/">gini</a>. I also co-founded Oxford Strategy Group Digital, Oxfordâ€™s first student-led data science consultancy group.
